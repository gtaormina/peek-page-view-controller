This project started from this [StackOverflow question](http://stackoverflow.com/a/32386551/484780) and not being able to find a library out there with this functionality.

>FYI, I used these [util functions](https://gist.github.com/kjantzer/dcc7deb3d2f53e12205b) to adjust the size of the view frames; I get sick of manually changing them with 3+ lines of code.
